  Welcome to Jamming.Y's world! 
  I'm an underguaduate student majoring in Information and Computing Science at EECS,PKU.
  My research interests now especially lies in Computer Vision.
  It is my great fortune to work as an undergraduate intern at the Spatial and Temporal Restoration, Understanding and Compression Team (STRUCT) of Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology (WICT), mentored by Prof. Jiaying Liu.
  I love many kinds of sports, including football, basketball, badminton, table tennis, and running.
  I'm also a big fan of Atletico de Madrid.
  I love music, but not such an expert.
  I'm looking forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences with you!
